    "One of the major car manufacturers has also become interested in investing in electric cars. They are still in the early stages of developing a fully electric car and management is a bit skeptic about the profitability of the investment. The R&D program involved multiple stages and required immediate capital outlays, while the cash inflows would be expected at a later point in time, as shown in the figure below. Management uses an opportunity cost of capital of 16% and a risk-free rate of 2%. Cash inflows are discounted with the cost of capital and cash outflows are discounted with the risk-free rate.\n",

However, you mention to them that they do not have to commit to both stages immediately.
